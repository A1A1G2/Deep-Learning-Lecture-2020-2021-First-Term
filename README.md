# Introduction To Deep Learning Lecture

Repository of 2020-2021 first term Introduction to Deep Learning lecture. Contains lecture materials, notebook, datasets etc.

**Intructors:**
- Şafak Bilici
- Oğuzhan Ercan

## Notebook Links
Github does not render LaTeX well. So clone the repo and use notebooks in localhost, or use following links. (Even though following links, wait 10 or 15 seconds to LaTeX rendering).
